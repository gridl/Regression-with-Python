# Regression with Python

I wrote a tutorial on how to do linear and non linear fit in Python with scipy. I give practical examples that can be applied very easily to several use cases. In particular, I think that People will find interesting the discussion and the code example on how to find ideal intial Parameters for a non linear fit.

In particular I give an example on how to use the functions **curve_fit()** and **differential_evolution()** to do a (kind of) grid search for the itinial Parameters that are as close to the right one as possible.
As usual, I Keep all my code on this github respository. So feel free to check the Jupyter Notebook directly, or download code and data files.
